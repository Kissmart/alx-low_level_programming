The I/O request is intercepted by a network redirector, also referred to simply as a redirector, on the local computer. This is depicted in the preceding figure by the solid arrow between the application and the client redirector.
The redirector constructs a data packet containing all of the information about the request, and sends it to the server where the file is located. This is depicted in the preceding figure by the solid arrow between the client redirector and the server redirector.
The redirector on the server receives the packet from the client, authenticates the access to the file required by the I/O request, and, if authenticated, executes the request on behalf of the client. If not, it returns an error code to the redirector on the client. This is depicted in the preceding figure by the curved solid arrow between the server redirector and the file.
